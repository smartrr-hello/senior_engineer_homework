# Backend Engineer (TypeScript) take home Exam

## Project Overview

Your task is to develop a TypeScript / React application that interacts with the [Currency Converter API](https://rapidapi.com/natkapral/api/currency-converter5). The goal is to continuously fetch and display the currency conversion rates between USD and BRL for the last 24 hours.

The details of each step are outlined below:

1. Building the Application
Develop a TypeScript / React application. Your application should be well-structured and follow best practices for TypeScript and React development. You should also ensure that your code is clean, efficient, and well-documented.

1. Developing the Function
Write a function that uses the Currency Converter API to pull the USD / BRL currency conversion rates. This function should be scheduled to run every hour, ensuring that your application is continuously updated with the most recent conversion rates. Consider retry logic, timeouts, and other error-handling strategies to ensure that your application is robust.

1. Displaying the Conversion Rates
Create a React page that displays the conversion rates for the last 24 hours. 

Your application should update this page every time it fetches new conversion rates, ensuring that your users always have access to the most recent data.

1. Writing Tests
Include tests to validate your application's functionality.

You should write tests for your currency conversion function and tests for your React components.

1. Updating the README
Update the `README` file with clear and concise instructions on how to run your application. Include any necessary setup steps, such as installing dependencies or setting up an API key for the Currency Converter API.

Make sure to write your instructions in a way that can be understood by developers of all experience levels.

1. Submitting Your Code
Once you have completed your application, push your code to a remote repository (GitHub or GitLab) so that it can be reviewed. Ensure that you include all necessary files and exclude any files that should not be in source control (like `node_modules` or your `.env` file with your API keys).

If we schedule an interview with you, we will ask you to walk us through your code and explain your thought process. We will also ask you to make some changes to your code to add a new feature and appropriate tests, so be prepared to make some adjustments.

Good luck, and happy coding!
